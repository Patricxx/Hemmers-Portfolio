              Patrick worked as a senior member of our team from June 2019 until
              May 2020. I had the pleasure to know Patrick as a creative and
              intelligent designer who is able to understand and resolve complex
              client needs. He was also able to manage his time well and meet
              tight deadlines when required. Patrick is an excellent
              communicator in both Dutch and English and enjoys sharing his
              opinions with others. He has very good software skills and a
              serious interest in typography.

            Canada, where his international experience was really useful to the
            process. Patrick has very good social skills and cares about the
            people around him. He was a real asset to our team during his time
            with us.Â

              my jewelry logo, website, branding and typography in 2018. He has
              developed my logo for my jewelry company from start to finish with
              great ability to translate my vision and what my brand represents
              and stands for. It was a great delight working together with
              Patrick, his patience and his enthusiasm creating and exchanging
              ideas on what could work for my brand was truly inspiring.
